# FileTamperChecker
A Python script that generates a selected file's checksum, stores it(in a JSON file), and allows the file to be rechecked to see if the file has been altered

In the future I might attempt a system where the code is run on a schedule and checks a prepicked list to verify the files contents (Think of it as Captain Hindsight for Ransomware)
